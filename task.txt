We are developing a medieval-themed game and will focus on creating a minimum viable product (MVP) for the demo. The MVP should include the following features: 
1. Character movement mechanics.
2. A health system for the character that allows for taking damage and dealing damage to enemies.
3. Collision detection and response for interactions between the character and other entities in the game.
